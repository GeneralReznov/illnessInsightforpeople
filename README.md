## Local Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- uv package manager (recommended) or pip

### Installation

1. **Clone the repo**
   ```bash
   git clone (https://github.com/GeneralReznov/illnessInsightforpeople)
   cd illnessinsight_deploy
   ```

2. **Install uv (if not already installed)**
   ```bash
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   ```
